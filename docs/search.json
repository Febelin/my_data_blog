The following milestones have been achieved:\n\nWebsite Framework Setup: Successfully deployed the initial Quarto blog structure and project repository. The platform is now ready to host interactive components and research updates.\nData Cleaning: Processed the raw survey data from 130 valid participants (\\(N=130\\)). Key tasks included:\n\nStandardizing geographic tags for mapping.\nCleaning and categorizing platform usage frequency and duration.\n\nVisualization Planning: Currently designing the exploratory data analysis phase."
