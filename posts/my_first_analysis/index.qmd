## Introduction

The term **"TikTok Refugees"** describes a growing demographic of users who have migrated their digital presence from TikTok to RedNote (Xiaohongshu). This research explores the drivers behind this cross-platform migration, focusing on how geographic characteristics and privacy perceptions influence their transition between a US-based and a China-based ecosystem.

## Project Progress

## Project Progress (Week 7)

This week, I focused on moving from raw data to a structured project environment. The following milestones have been achieved:

-   **Website Framework Setup:** Successfully deployed the initial Quarto blog structure and project repository. The platform is now ready to host interactive components and research updates.
-   **Data Cleaning:** Processed the raw survey data from **130 valid participants (**$N=130$). Key tasks included:
    -   Standardizing geographic tags for mapping.
    -   Cleaning and categorizing platform usage frequency and duration.
-   **Visualization Planning:** Currently designing the exploratory data analysis phase.

## Preliminary Visualizations

**Note on Visualization:** While the table above provides a precise numerical breakdown, I am currently prototyping interactive maps and correlation plots to better illustrate the geographic trends and user motivations.
